equity,putting on an exhibit,"Whose stories are being told, and by whom?","When putting on an exhibit, you are telling a set of stories—about art, about history, about a group of people or a place.

By thinking about what stories are being told and what stories you might be omitting, you can be more intentional and equitable to historically marginalized or erased populations. If your exhibit centers on a geographic area, are you only displaying stories of the colonizers of that area, or also including indigenous stories? If you’re displaying art from a particular time period, are you only displaying the agreed-upon “canonical” artists of that period, a categorization often rooted in exclusion and white supremacy, or are you digging deeper to display genuine diversity of expression?

Of course, the context of your curation always has other factors, but if you are creating an exhibit with equity in mind, it is necessary to be aware of the factors that create exclusion. If you find that you cannot uplift marginalized voices because the boundaries of your exhibit are too narrow—for example, a specific school of painters all of whom were white men—this may require a more fundamental shift. Interrogate why you want to create work around that school. If you still wish to do so, then perhaps include framing that acknowledges that school itself as exclusionary, and explains the economic and social barriers to inclusion for people outside of white cis masculinity."

Writing a book is the most solitary of the activities we’ve listed here, but one of the things we emphasize in <a href=""https://humetricshss.org/our-work/workshops/"">our workshop process</a> is that every scholarly product, i.e. a book, an article, etc can be broken down into a set of processes and microtransactions, and in many of those smaller moments along the way we tend to involve others—mentors, colleagues, research assistants—who improve our work in various ways. Traditionally, we recognize these people in an acknowledgments section of a book, but there are other possibilities as well—thanking contributors publicly in any talks you might give about the book, in your publicity for the book, or on social media.
